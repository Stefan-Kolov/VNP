    "## The Mental Health Diagnosis and Treatment Monitoring Dataset\n",
    "The dataset contains information on 500 individuals, focusing on mental health diagnoses, treatment plans, and outcomes. Key features include patient demographics such as age and gender, as well as specific mental health conditions (e.g., anxiety, depression, etc.). The dataset also captures symptom severity, mood scores, sleep quality, and stress levels, all rated on a scale of 1 to 10, providing insight into the patient's mental and physical well-being. Additionally, it includes details on treatment plans, including prescribed medications (e.g., SSRIs, antidepressants, etc.), therapy types (e.g., CBT, DBT, etc.), and treatment duration. Progress tracking is also incorporated, with ratings for treatment progress and AI-detected emotional state, alongside adherence to the treatment plan. The 'outcome' attribute, which indicates whether the treatment was improved, deteriorated, or unaffected, serves as the target variable for the analysis, while the remaining attributes can be used to explore and model the factors affecting mental health treatment outcomes."
