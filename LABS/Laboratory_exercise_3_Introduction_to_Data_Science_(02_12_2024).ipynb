    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this laboratory assignment, the focus is on time series forecasting, specifically targeting the prediction of the current **average sea-level pressure** in the city of Skopje. Your task involves employing bagging and boosting methods to forecast the average sea-level pressure. To accomplish this, you will use data from the preceding three days, consisting of average, minimal, and maximal temperatures, precipitation, as well as wind direction and speed, and the current season. By applying these ensemble learning techniques, you aim to enhance the accuracy and reliability of your predictions, gaining valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of sea-level pressure based on the given meteorological variables.\n",
